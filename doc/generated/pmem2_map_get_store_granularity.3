.nf
\f[C]
#include <libpmem2.h>

enum pmem2_granularity {
    PMEM2_GRANULARITY_BYTE,
    PMEM2_GRANULARITY_CACHE_LINE,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_map_get_store_granularity\f[R]() function reads
granularity of the created mapping.
The \f[I]map\f[R] parameter points to the structure describing mapping
created using the \f[B]pmem2_map\f[R](3) function.
Concept of the granularity is described in \f[B]libpmem2\f[R](7).
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_map_get_store_granularity\f[R]() function returns a
granularity of the mapped area.
