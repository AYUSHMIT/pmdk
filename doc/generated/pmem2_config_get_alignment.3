\f[B]pmem2_config_get_alignment\f[]() \- query an alignment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmem2.h>

struct\ pmem2_config;
int\ pmem2_config_get_alignment(const\ struct\ pmem2_config\ *config,\ size_t\ *alignment);
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_config_get_alignment\f[]() function retrieves the
alignment of offset and length needed for \f[B]pmem2_map\f[](3) to
succeed.
The alignment is stored in \f[I]*alignment\f[].
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_config_get_alignment\f[]() function returns 0 on success.
If the function fails, the \f[I]*alignment\f[] variable is left
unmodified, and one of the following errors is returned:
.PP
On all systems:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_FILE_HANDLE_NOT_SET\f[] \- config doesn't contain the file
handle (see \f[B]pmem2_config_set_fd\f[](3),
\f[B]pmem2_config_set_handle\f[](3)).
.PP
on Linux and FreeBSD:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_INVALID_FILE_HANDLE\f[] \- config contains an invalid file
handle.
.PP
on Linux:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_INVALID_FILE_TYPE\f[] \- file descriptor points to a
directory, block device, pipe, or socket.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_INVALID_FILE_TYPE\f[] \- file descriptor points to a
character device other than Device DAX.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_INVALID_ALIGNMENT_FORMAT\f[] \- kernel query for Device DAX
alignment returned data in invalid format.
.IP \[bu] 2
\-\f[B]errno\f[] set by failing \f[B]fstat\f[](2), while trying to
validate the file descriptor.
.IP \[bu] 2
\-\f[B]errno\f[] set by failing \f[B]realpath\f[](3), while trying to
determine whether fd points to a Device DAX.
.IP \[bu] 2
\-\f[B]errno\f[] set by failing \f[B]read\f[](2), while trying to
determine Device DAX's alignment.
.IP \[bu] 2
\-\f[B]errno\f[] set by failing \f[B]strtoull\f[](3), while trying to
determine Device DAX's alignment.
.PP
On FreeBSD:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM2_E_INVALID_FILE_TYPE\f[] \- file descriptor points to a
directory, block device, pipe, socket, or character device.
.IP \[bu] 2
\-\f[B]errno\f[] set by failing \f[B]fstat\f[](2), while trying to
validate the file descriptor.
