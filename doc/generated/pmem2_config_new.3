.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]pmem2_config_new\f[R](), \f[B]pmem2_config_delete\f[R]() \-
allocate and free a configuration for a libpmem2 mapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <libpmem2.h>

struct pmem2_config;
int pmem2_config_new(struct pmem2_config **cfg);
int pmem2_config_delete(struct pmem2_config **cfg);
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_config_new\f[R]() function instantiates a new (opaque)
configuration structure, \f[I]pmem2_config\f[R], which is used to define
mapping parameters for a \f[B]pmem2_map\f[R]() function, and returns it
through the pointer in \f[I]*cfg\f[R].
.PP
New configuration is always initialized with default values for all
possible parameters, which are specified alongside the corresponding
setter function.
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_config_delete\f[R]() function frees \f[I]*cfg\f[R]
returned by \f[B]pmem2_config_new\f[R]() and sets \f[I]*cfg\f[R] to
NULL.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_config_new\f[R]() function returns 0 on success or a
negative error code on failure.
\f[B]pmem2_config_new\f[R]() does set \f[I]*cfg\f[R] to NULL on failure.
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_config_delete\f[R]() function returns 0.
.PP
Please see \f[B]libpmem2\f[R](7) for detailed description of libpmem2
error codes.
.SH ERRORS
.PP
\f[B]pmem2_config_new\f[R]() can fail with the following error: \-
\f[B]\-ENOMEM\f[R] \- out of memory
